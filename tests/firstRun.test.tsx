/* The first thirty seconds.

   Four acts, and the fourth is the point: the entry somebody just made becomes
   the first card on their timeline. What these tests protect is the shape of
   that — two questions and no more before a real entry exists, the entry being
   *real* rather than a demo, and the promise on the hero being visible without
   anybody having to open anything.

   Motion is not asserted here (jsdom has no layout, and every helper is a
   no-op under reduced motion, which these tests run with). What is asserted is
   that the flow still completes with the motion switched off — which is the
   guarantee that actually matters to somebody who has it switched off. */
